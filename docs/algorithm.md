# algorithm

​	The algorithms provided by the system are `DQN PPO QMIX MADDPG`, if you want to use more algorithms, you can customize them using the APIs provided by the system. The system provides three APIs to decouple the reinforcement algorithm, `Model` corresponds to neural network and other models, `Embryo` is used to implement policy iteration of reinforcement learning algorithm, `Agent`  is used to handle operations related to environment interactions.

​	Of course, you can also contact us and we will try our best to solve your problem.
